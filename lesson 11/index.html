            <h2>Minimize code duplication</h2>
            <p>
                Keeping code DRY and maintainable is one of the biggest challenges in software development, and that
                applies to CSS as well. In practice, one big component of maintainable code is minimizing the amount of
                edits necessary to make a change. When values depend on each other, try to reflect their relationship in
                the code.

            <h2>On Responsive Web Design</h2>
            <p>
                The common practice is testing a website in multiple resolutions and adding more and more media queries
                to fix the issues that arise. However, every media query adds overhead to future CSS changes, and they
                should not be added lightly. Here are a few more tips to avoid needless media queries:
            <ul>
                <li>Use percentagesor viewport-relative units instead of fixed widths.</li>
                <li>When you want a fixed width for larger resolutions,use max-width, not width.</li>
                <li>When using multi-column text, specify column-width instead of column-count,so that you get one
                    column only in small resolutions.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Use shorthands wisely</h2>
            <p>
                You could of course try to set all the longhands and call it a day, but then you might forget some. Or
                the CSS WG might introduce more long- hands in the future, and your code will have failed to reset
                those. Don't be afraid of shorthands. It is good defensive coding and future-proofing to use them,
                unless we intentionally want to use cascaded properties for everything else.
